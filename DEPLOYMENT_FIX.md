# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Issue
The deployment was failing on Netlify with the following error:
```
getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN fonts.googleapis.com
Failed to fetch `Inter` from Google Fonts
```

## Root Cause
The Next.js build process was trying to fetch Google Fonts during build time, but Netlify's build environment had network restrictions that prevented access to external resources like fonts.googleapis.com.

## Solution
1. **Removed Google Fonts dependency**:
   - Removed `import { Inter } from "next/font/google"`
   - Replaced with system fonts using Tailwind's `font-sans` class

2. **Updated layout.tsx**:
   - Removed Google Fonts preconnect links
   - Changed from `{inter.className}` to `"font-sans"`

3. **Fixed netlify.toml configuration**:
   - Set `publish = ""` (correct for @netlify/plugin-nextjs)
   - Removed incorrect SPA redirect rule
   - Updated Node.js version to match .nvmrc

## Benefits
- ✅ No external network dependencies during build
- ✅ Faster build times (no font downloads)
- ✅ More reliable deployment process
- ✅ Better fallback support across different systems

## Fonts Used
The application now uses the system font stack via Tailwind's `font-sans`:
- `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`

This provides excellent readability and performance across all platforms while maintaining a consistent, professional appearance.
