# Device Status Monitor Architecture Cleanup

## Issue
- VS Code showing TypeScript error for `device-status-monitor-provider.tsx`
- Error: "Cannot find module '@/lib/device-status-monitor'"
- File appears to exist in editor but not on filesystem

## Root Cause Analysis
The `DeviceStatusMonitorProvider` component was a standalone provider that was **replaced** by integrating device status monitoring directly into the existing `RealtimeAttendanceProvider`. 

## Current Architecture ✅

### Device Status Monitoring Location
Device status monitoring is now handled in:
- **File**: `/components/realtime-attendance-provider.tsx`
- **Integration**: Lines that import and use device status monitor functions
- **Usage**: Automatically starts/stops device monitoring in the global provider

### How It Works
1. `RealtimeAttendanceProvider` wraps the entire app in `app/layout.tsx`
2. It imports `startDeviceStatusMonitor` and `stopDeviceStatusMonitor` from `@/lib/device-status-monitor`
3. Device monitoring runs automatically in the background
4. No separate provider component needed

## Files Status

### ✅ Active Files
- `/lib/device-status-monitor.ts` - Core monitoring logic
- `/components/realtime-attendance-provider.tsx` - Integrated provider
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Uses RealtimeAttendanceProvider

### ❌ Removed/Obsolete Files  
- `device-status-monitor-provider.tsx` - **Should not exist** (replaced by integration)

## Resolution
If you see `device-status-monitor-provider.tsx` in VS Code:
1. **Close the tab** without saving (if it's an unsaved file)
2. **Verify file doesn't exist** on filesystem
3. **Use RealtimeAttendanceProvider** instead (already in place)

## Verification
✅ TypeScript compilation passes when obsolete file is not present
✅ Device monitoring works through RealtimeAttendanceProvider
✅ No duplicate monitoring logic
✅ Clean architecture with single responsibility

*Architecture: Device monitoring integrated into main provider*
*Status: RESOLVED - Use RealtimeAttendanceProvider*
