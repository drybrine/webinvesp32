# CSS @tailwind Directive Recognition Fixed

## Issue
- VS Code was showing "Unknown at rule @tailwind" warnings in CSS files
- The CSS language server wasn't recognizing Tailwind CSS directives

## Root Cause
- Missing VS Code workspace configuration for Tailwind CSS support
- Duplicate PostCSS configuration files causing potential conflicts
- CSS language server not configured to understand Tailwind directives

## Solution Applied

### 1. Standardized PostCSS Configuration
- Removed duplicate `postcss.config.js`
- Updated `postcss.config.mjs` to include both `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer`

### 2. VS Code Workspace Configuration
Created `.vscode/settings.json` with:
- Disabled native CSS validation (conflicts with Tailwind)
- Added custom CSS data for Tailwind directives
- Configured Tailwind CSS IntelliSense settings
- Set file associations for proper CSS processing

### 3. Tailwind CSS Custom Data
Created `.vscode/tailwind.json` with definitions for:
- `@tailwind` directive
- `@apply` directive  
- `@layer` directive
- `@screen` directive
- `@variants` directive
- `@responsive` directive

### 4. Extensions Installed
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** (`bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`) - Provides autocomplete and syntax highlighting
- **PostCSS Language Support** (`csstools.postcss`) - Already installed, handles PostCSS syntax

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace settings
- `.vscode/tailwind.json` - Tailwind CSS custom data definitions

### Modified Files:
- `postcss.config.mjs` - Added autoprefixer plugin
- Removed: `postcss.config.js` - Eliminated duplicate config

### Deleted Files:
- `postcss.config.js` - Removed duplicate configuration

## Expected Results
After reloading VS Code or restarting the language server:
- ✅ No more "Unknown at rule @tailwind" warnings
- ✅ Tailwind CSS autocomplete and IntelliSense working
- ✅ Proper syntax highlighting for Tailwind directives
- ✅ CSS validation that understands Tailwind syntax

## Build Status
- ✅ Project builds successfully without warnings
- ✅ Tailwind CSS processing works correctly
- ✅ All styles compile and apply properly

## Next Steps
1. Reload VS Code window or restart the language server
2. Verify that CSS warnings are resolved
3. Test Tailwind CSS autocomplete functionality
