# Netlify Build Fix - PNPM Lockfile Mismatch

## Issue
Netlify deployment was failing with error:
```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" 
because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json

Failure reason:
specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
* 1 dependencies were removed: react-day-picker@8.10.1
```

## Root Cause
1. We removed `react-day-picker` from `package.json` to resolve React 19 conflicts
2. However, `pnpm-lock.yaml` still contained the old lockfile with that dependency
3. Netlify uses `--frozen-lockfile` by default, requiring exact match between package.json and lockfile

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated PNPM Lockfile
```bash
# Regenerated lockfile to match current package.json
pnpm install
```

### 2. Additional Cleanup (Optional)
- Also removed unused `vaul` dependency that had React 19 peer conflicts
- Deleted unused `components/ui/drawer.tsx` component
- This eliminated all remaining peer dependency warnings

## Files Changed

### Package Management:
- `package.json` - React 19 conflicting dependencies removed
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated to match current package.json
- `package-lock.json` - Also updated (npm artifacts)

### Components Removed:
- `components/ui/calendar.tsx` - Used react-day-picker (unused)
- `components/ui/drawer.tsx` - Used vaul (unused)

## Results

### Before Fix:
❌ Netlify build failing: `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`
❌ React 19 peer dependency conflicts
❌ Unused dependencies causing warnings

### After Fix:
✅ Netlify deployment working
✅ Clean dependency tree with React 19 support
✅ No peer dependency warnings
✅ Smaller bundle size (removed unused deps)
✅ Build time improved

## Build Status
- ✅ **Local build**: Successful with no warnings
- ✅ **TypeScript**: No errors
- ✅ **Netlify deployment**: Fixed and working
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All compatible with React 19

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test local build
npm run build

# Check for dependency issues
pnpm install --dry-run

# Verify no TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Netlify Build Process
The fix ensures Netlify can:
1. Install dependencies with frozen lockfile (required for production builds)
2. Build successfully without React version conflicts
3. Deploy with optimized bundle (no unused dependencies)
