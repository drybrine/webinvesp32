# React 19 Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue
- `react-day-picker@8.10.1` had peer dependency conflicts with React 19
- The package only supported React 16.8, 17, and 18
- This was causing npm install and build warnings/errors

## Root Cause Analysis
- The Calendar UI component (`components/ui/calendar.tsx`) was the only user of `react-day-picker`
- However, this Calendar component was never actually imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- All `Calendar` imports in the project were actually referring to the Calendar icon from `lucide-react`, not the UI component

## Solution
1. **Removed unused dependency**: Uninstalled `react-day-picker` using `npm uninstall react-day-picker --legacy-peer-deps`
2. **Removed unused component**: Deleted `components/ui/calendar.tsx` since it wasn't being used
3. **Verified no impact**: Confirmed that all Calendar references in the code are icons from `lucide-react`

## Files Changed
- Removed: `components/ui/calendar.tsx`
- Modified: `package.json` (removed react-day-picker dependency)
- Modified: `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` (dependency updates)

## Verification
- ✅ Build now completes successfully with no warnings
- ✅ No React 19 peer dependency conflicts
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved (Calendar icons still work)
- ✅ Development server starts without issues

## Status
**RESOLVED** - React 19 dependency conflicts eliminated by removing unused calendar dependency.
